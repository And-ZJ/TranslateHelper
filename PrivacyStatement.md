## What information do you collect?

This plug-in only collects and saves **your personalized settings for the plug-in**. For example, whether the "format" function option is turned on, and whether the "tab becomes 4 spaces" option is selected.

In addition, no other data types were collected. For example, we did not collect your IP address information, your Google account and other information, the website you visited, the input and output information on the web page, Chrome bookmarks or history records, and any local file information of your computer.

There is no need to register an account to use this plug-in, so there is no account information to be collected.

If you need to contact the developer, you may need to use your private or public email account or GitHub website account to get in touch with the developer. However, the developer cannot associate these email accounts with the information collected above.

## How is information stored and used?

The above collected **your personalized settings for plug-ins** are saved using the automatic synchronization API provided by chrome, which will save **your personalized settings of plug-ins** to Google's server. Therefore, even developers can't get your data or associate it with your account. Because developers can't get this data, they can't share it with third parties.

Save your personalization. First, you can save your changes to the plug-in settings, which helps you to achieve your own personalized experience, rather than the default experience. Second, it can take advantage of Chrome's automatic synchronization function to synchronize your settings changes on multiple terminals, which helps you to experience consistency.

It should be noted that when chrome will save or synchronize **your personalized settings for plug-ins** to the server, developers cannot know and cannot intervene in this process.

The sychronization API interface used by developers is as follows: *chrome.storage.sync*

Unless you contact the developer, the developer will not know whether you are using the plug-in.

## How do you protect information?

As mentioned above, developers cannot obtain **your personalized settings for plug-ins**. The security of data transmission and storage is guaranteed by Chrome's synchronization API.

Developers promise that, except for the legal requirements to provide or obtain your authorization, developers will not disclose all or part of the content of the email between you and the developer. Of course, your email address will also be protected.
